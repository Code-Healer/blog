    <h1>The first step</h1>

<p>To give the first step is always hard.</p>

<p>
    Sometimes is necessary to start a new thing or project, in my case, left the inertia is a hard step. As a software developer I am always thinking about a thousand things, be it programming languages, frameworks, ways to solve problems, etc., it's a practical profession, but with a lot of creativity and mental charge every day, and sometimes I lose myself in this thoughts being paralyzed by analysis, procrastination and anxiety. But let's stop with this sad talk (for now), this blog is not for it (mostly).
</p>
    <p>
        My main goal with this blog is not to help you, but to help me. Possibly my insights can be useful to you too, and totally free, once that is not another immersion week or bootcamp with a proposition to an expensive course in the end, all materials in this blog will be majority from free sources and the posts, lessons, tutorials and knowledge created here will be free too.
    </p>
<p>
    So, why create a blog instead use substack or other third party service? Because I want to run the entire path to deliver and mantain a site, choosing all tools and learning with my choices. In the past I create a blog and use Zeit (Vercel) as host, and because of that I didn't create and configure the domain, it's a simple issue, but I want to do this type of things, like many others that you can't do when you are a programmer in a professional team, once this decisions already been made in the past, it's rare you start a new project in consolidated companies or maybe use old tech like pure lisp or pascal to create something without justify your choice. Just for fun! We can learn a lot doing things like that and the best part, avoiding risk of erase a production database.
</p>
<p>
    Then if you read until here, we can start this project. In this moment I don't know what I will use or what features this blog shoud have. So, let's make a list.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty: because I like of mascot</a></li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://pages.github.com/">
            Github Pages: It's free
        </a>
    </li>
    <li>Features:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>accessible from internet.</li>
        <li>Readable in my phone.</li>
        <li>it's all for now.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

If you notice my english is not perfect (yours probably isn't either), this is another thing that I'm trying to improve, I swear to use google translate a minimum possible.

In next post I will show how this page was going to the internet and the future evolutions. After all, this formatting is terrible.
