        How I said in the last post, I'm trying to maintain the things simple, and the first deploy was a single html pages, I didn't even use 11ty. Just because was not necessary to reach my initial needs, which were:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Readable in my phone.</li>
        <li>accessible from internet.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        To be <b>accessible from the internet</b> the blog would to be published, and following the steps from this site was very easy <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages Tutorial</a>. If you wish to check the code, pleaze look the first three commits in <a href="https://github.com/Code-Healer/code-healer.github.io">Blog Repository</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        And to be <b>readable in my phone</b> I just create a html page, It had been a long time since the last time I wrote a webpage using plain HTML, currently there are so many frameworks, tools and ways to create web apps and webpages that I have forgotten that plain html pages (if you use just text) are responsive.
    </p>

        Furthermore, a simple HTML page have a good performance in Google Lighthouse:

    <p>
        Cool Right!!
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In the next post, I will continue improving and explaining the home page (we will need one) and some improvements pointed out by Lighthouse. We need to define a maximum width because, on larger screens, it's hard to read. I will also probably fix image issues.
