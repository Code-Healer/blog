    <h1>Issues over time</h1>

<p>
    In this post I will record the issues that appears across de blog development, the idea is to have a real walkthrough of issues and needs that appeared over time.

<h2>
    Home page and navigation
</h2>
<p>
    The first post was commited in Index html page, because I wished to deploy and to see te results as soon as possible. However to deliver new posts was necessary to create a Home page to group posts and a mechanism to go back to home.

    I used simple html links `a` to solve this. Although there are many ways to implement navigation, including routes libraries, we can always remember that simple links can be very useful and enough to this situation.

<h2>
    Maximum width and readability
</h2>

<p>
    On large screens it was difficult to read because of the line length, so I set the maximum width to 960px. In future posts I intend to talk more about readability.
