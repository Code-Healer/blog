# The first deploy and the power of plain html

*Florian√≥polis, Friday - 2024-05-31*

How I said in the last post, I'm trying to maintain the things simple, and the first deploy was a single html pages, I didn't even use 11ty. Just because was not necessary to reach my initial needs, which were:

- Readable in my phone.
- accessible from internet.

To be **accessible from the internet** the blog would to be published, and following the steps from this site was very easy [Github Pages Tutorial](https://pages.github.com/). If you wish to check the code, pleaze look the three first commits in [Blog Repository](https://github.com/Code-Healer/code-healer.github.io)

And to be **readable in my phone** I just create a html page, It had been a long time since the last time I wrote a webpage using plain HTML, currently there are so many frameworks, tools and ways to create web apps and webpages that I have forgotten that plain html pages (if you use just text) are responsive.

Furthermore, a simple HTML page have a good performance in Google Lighthouse:

Cool Right!!

In the next post, I will continue improving and explaining the home page (we will need one) and some improvements pointed out by Lighthouse. We need to define a maximum width because, on larger screens, it's hard to read. I will also probably fix image issues.
